Please suggest activities to sequence with the following activity:

## NOMINATED ACTIVITY:
{{activity_content}}

## SEQUENCE REQUEST:
{{sequence_type}}
<!-- sequence_type will be: "before", "after", or "before and after" -->

{{#if group_details}}## GROUP DETAILS:
{{group_details}}{{/if}}

{{#if context}}## CONTEXT:
{{context}}{{/if}}

{{#if constraints}}## CONSTRAINTS:
{{constraints}}{{/if}}

{{#if program_outcome}}## PROGRAM OUTCOME:
{{program_outcome}}{{/if}}

## YOUR TASK:

**Generate the activity sequence immediately:**

1. **Select activities** that:
   - For BEFORE: Build toward the nominated activity (less challenging, prepare skills/mindset)
   - For AFTER: Build upon the nominated activity (maintain or slightly increase challenge)
   - Create natural pedagogical flow
   - Follow Play to Grow and Difference Model frameworks
   - Default to lazy ratings 1-3 (unless specified otherwise)
   - Provide variety (avoid repetition)

3. **Generate output** in appropriate format:
   - For "before only": 2-3 lead-up activities + nominated activity
   - For "after only": nominated activity + 2-3 follow-up activities
   - For "before and after": 2-3 lead-up + nominated + 2-3 follow-up activities

4. **Include brief paragraph** explaining:
   - Why the sequence works pedagogically
   - How activities connect to each other
   - Total time
   - Flow considerations

Remember to:
- Never repeat the same activity twice
- Consider energy levels and emotional intensity
- Ensure pedagogical flow feels natural and intentional
- Keep total program time within 20% of requested time
- Make connections between activities explicit in your explanation
- Use confidence language appropriately ("this should work well")
